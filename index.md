## Treasure Hunt: Spelljamming though the Cosmos

### About
Drawn to the [Rock of Bral](03_The_Universe/Realmspace/The_Rock_of_Bral/Index.md) from their own respective Planes and Spheres the rag-tag group of mercenaries, The Baguette Boys, have found interesting work different then their usual adventure of delivering cargo. Proving themselves as competent fighters and jammers, they receive an interesting proposition from Prince Andru, leader/owner of the Rock of Bral who had been in contact with their captain about their next job.

[Prince Andru](01_NPCiary/The_Rock_of_Bral/3_The_High_City/Prince%20Andru.md) has been working with the [Prismatic Order of Thought](01_NPCiary/Organizations/Prismatic_Order_of_Thought/Index.md) and has given you official permission to make war on all pirates. Providing you with the [Letters of Marque](06_Handouts/Papers/Letters%20of%20Marque.md), these letters entitle you to war on all pirating vessels in wildspace or in the Flow. They do not authorize attacks or assassination attempts against anyone when they are not on a vessel underway.  These letters also give you authority to make war on the mercenary company known as the 10th pit, a terroristic group that has been growing in power.

The future seems bright as the crew refits their ship and heads out to collect a pirate bounty.
