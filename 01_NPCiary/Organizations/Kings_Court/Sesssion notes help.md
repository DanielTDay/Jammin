Re-write my bullet-point notes in the style of Wayne June from Darkest Dungeon, his voice is deep, commanding, and ominous, with a hint of gravelly roughness to it. He delivers his lines in a deliberate and measured manner, emphasizing certain words and phrases to add weight and gravitas to the dialogue.
