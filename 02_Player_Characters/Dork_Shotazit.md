## Description

Dork is an enigmatic and otherworldly being, residing in a simple flower pot in the company of a genie. This Plasmoid is a ball of pulsing energy, shimmering with an inner light in a vibrant shade of purple. Its surface is constantly shifting and changing, crackling with energy. Despite its small size, it radiates an aura of power and mystery.

Dork's form is constantly in flux, usually it will take on a humanoid form but when they're feeling playful, it might form itself into simple shapes, like a flower or a star on the front on their shield. The Plasmoid's behavior is also quite unpredictable, sometimes bubbling with excitement, other times seeming to sink into a state of quiet contemplation.

You have made a pact with one of the rarest kinds of genie, a noble genie. Such entities rule vast fiefs on the Elemental Planes and have great influence over lesser genies and elemental creatures. Noble genies are varied in their motivations, but most are arrogant and wield power that rivals that of lesser deities. They delight in turning the table on mortals, who often bind genies into servitude, and readily enter into pacts that expand their reach.

Plasmoids are amorphous beings with no typical shape. In the presence of other folk, they often adopt a similar shape, but there’s little chance of mistaking a plasmoid for anything else. They consume food by osmosis, the way an amoeba does, and excrete waste through tiny pores. They breathe by absorbing oxygen through another set of pores, and their limbs are strong and flexible enough to grasp and manipulate weapons and tools. Although most plasmoids are translucent gray, they can alter their color and translucence by absorbing dyes through their pores.

Plasmoids don’t have internal organs of the usual sort. Their bodies are composed of cells, fibers, plasma-like ooze, and clusters of nerves. These nerves enable a plasmoid to detect light, heat, texture, sound, pain, and vibrations. Plasmoids can stiffen the outer layers of their bodies to maintain a humanlike shape, so they can wear clothing and accessories. They speak by forcing air out of tubular cavities that constrict to produce sound.

When plasmoids sleep, they lose their rigidity and spread out and are thus sometimes mistaken for a rock or some other feature of the environment.
