From the planet Chatarak they fled, clutching the Relic and the severed finger of the notorious pirate Erik who had held the town of refuge in thrall for eons.

But their joyous escape was short-lived, for upon identification of the Relic, it was revealed to be the coveted Chronolometer - one of the six keys to the fabled Orrery of the Wanderer. A powerful device that could tap into the very fabric of planar magic.

The group recalled Erik's ominous words - that when all keys are united, the door will open to reveal a powerful magic relic that could infuse one's spirit with the dark energies of the planes, a harbinger of malevolence and terror.

As they traversed realmspace, they were ambushed by Brown Scavvers - vicious, shark-like creatures that soar through the void, feeding on whatever they can devour. With Randy's help, Pobis vaporized one of the beasts, while the rest of the crew battled the other, determined not to fall prey to its deadly jaws.

Upon reaching the Rock of Bral, they spun a web of deceit with the customs officer, convincing him of their affiliation with the Prismatic Order of Thought, and thus gaining access to a docking station without paying the required tax. But they soon learned that Prince Andru had increased security throughout the realm, due to rumors of nefarious deeds afoot.

Ka'Chow secured their treasures, and each member went their separate ways to complete errands before meeting back at the ship in two hours' time.

Ka'Chow visited Da's Lock and Key, where he encountered a lock he had been searching for his entire life - and was given a key to open it. Pobis went to the Holy Keep of Bane, where he helped his friend Halwarin combat the unholy that had crept in. Dork visited the lesser market and almost fell prey to a pickpocket, but managed to purchase a few issues of MOID magazine. Randy went to Sakkar's exotic goods to inquire about improving his armor, but ultimately left empty-handed. Deekeek went to Balic's Blades to strike a deal with the blacksmith Old Balic, and then to Zada's Mounts and Harnesses where he was saddened by the poor conditions of the creatures there, but purchased a few companions.

Finally, the crew regrouped at the shipyard, where they made plans to visit the Ironworks to update ship parts and the lower magistrate to turn in their bounty and locate their captain. A journey fraught with danger, but one they were willing to undertake for the sake of adventure and treasure.

In a world of dark adventure, where danger lurks at every turn, our heroes embark on a journey of mystery and intrigue. Ka'Chow, a man of cunning and skill, ventured forth to Dal's Lock and Key to aid his friend Daliddin Nimblefist. A mysterious lock had stumped his friend, but with a flick of his wrist and a twist of a key, Ka'Chow unlocked the secrets hidden within. As they conversed, Ka'Chow learned that this lock was from the royal theater company, a key that he had been searching for his entire life.

Pobis, a man of faith, went to the Holy Keep of Bane to aid his friend Halwarin in his struggle against the unholy. The temple, once a beacon of lawful good, was now plagued by darkness. Pobis cleansed the temple and offered his services to Halwarin. But as he looked upon the walls, he saw a new symbol, that of Istus, the goddess of fate. A symbol that he had seen before, in a temple where he had sought refuge. As he found peace in the church, the symbol pulsed with a faint light.

Dork, a man of wit and humor, made his way to the lesser market, a place of chaos and noise. He sought out Negin Lighthopper, a merchant who sold the latest issues of MOID magazine. But as he made his way through the crowd, a pickpocket tried to take his purse. He purchased two magazines, disappointed to find that purple was still not in style. On his way back to the ship, he narrowly avoided a group of street racers. Negin informed him of the increased racing activity in recent months.

Randy, a man of stealth and cunning, made his way to Sakkar's exotic goods to refit his armor. But as he contemplated the offer, he instead went to the Sign of the Black Bull, a tavern favored by mercenaries and assassins. As he tried to gather information from the bartender, he was met with silence. Undeterred, he purchased a study binder for thievescant, the main language spoken in the tavern. As he left, his eyes glowed with a fierce determination.

Deekeek, a man of strength and honor, went to Balic's Blades to converse with Old Balic, the blacksmith. They struck a deal, where Deekeek would exchange an emerald for the improvement of one of his sabers over the next month. He then went to Zada's Mounts and Harnesses, disappointed with the quality and life of the creatures there. He purchased a hamster, space guppies, and a small eel for companionship. He attempted to tame one of the griffins but was unsuccessful. He left with a heavy heart, swearing to return and save those poor creatures from their plight.

As they regrouped in the shipyard, the shadow of their vessel, the Genocide, loomed over them. It was clear that their work was not yet done. They needed to venture to the Ironworks, to improve their vessel's parts, and to the lower magistrate, to seek out their captain and turn in their hard-won bounty. The journey ahead promised danger and uncertainty, but these brave souls were determined to see it through to the end.
