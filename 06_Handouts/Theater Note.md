FRont

A winding path 'pon hill green grass and on through crisp, cool air, where one shall find atlast the remnants of a shattered Tower, there.

    A vast and twisted apparition, choked with vines unfurled, to disappear through brooding cloud above.

    The eye partakes this broken visage; slate-blue steel collapsed upon exposed, meandering stairwells, where rot-speckled moulds claim obliterated rooms half sunk and spoiled in grim, stale water floods.

    What frenzy wrought such destruction here? What raging fires left such blackened scars, and the clinging stench of rot?

    And what force holds together this crumbling catastrophe, now, where terrifying mysteries linger and lurk?

    Ascend then, we must, aboard sallow, murky air, ragged and sharp to breathe; but t'is not the Traveller who weeps, nor growls, but the shadow-folded denizen's that chitter, crawl, and creep.

    Each one protecting this Tower's legendary treasure; the jewel of many an ancient bardic song, hung one hundred and eleven floors up 'pon the cloud-strangled peak of this Carcosa

    Tis the Orry of the Wanderer.
