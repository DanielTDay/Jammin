# Mine Note

## **Chapter 1**

**Day 14

Finally, we have a true heading. For all the myths and tales of the relic and diamond hoard being located in this region, we have not found any clue as to exactly _where_. Until now!
Rumor has it that the ~~Ironwallow Company~~ has a quarry nearby that was removed from records. It’s vague information, but I have a good feeling about it.
I have never been so excited!

**Day 16

Our research into the secret quarry is bearing fruit. We have uncovered paperwork suggesting that equipment has been carried out of the city and to a location in the ~~northern fields~~. Best of all, not all of it was mining tools!
Erik questioned a representative of the company, who denied it despite her brilliant conversational skills. He really is incredible.
I have to wonder what possible reasons they could have for hiding the site? It must be that they’ve found evidence of the city and are hiding it. They want the glory for themselves, but this discovery belongs to the world.

**Day 20

We were right! We followed a cart of supplies that left the city and it led us straight to a quarry in the middle of nowhere.
For the moment, we are camped outside, observing. Crates are carried out of the entrance twice a day and carted towards the city. Workers are lifting them by hand, so they surely cannot be full of rocks or ore. Artifacts, perhaps? We followed one of the shipments back to town and saw it taken through the manor.
This is unacceptable. ~~Ironwallow~~ is obviously selling diamonds on a black market. The thought of them profiting from this town sickens me. How could they possibly value money over the the wealth they could bring this town?
Luca will sneak in tomorrow to find evidence. I trust his infiltration talents, and procuring one of the items could help us prove ~~Ironwallow~~’s crimes.

**Day 26

Luca is yet to return from the quarry.
Shipments continue like clockwork. The only change was several days ago when they dragged out and burned a large sack. It seemed to drip a dark trail and the fire’s smell was putrid.
Erik ran when he saw it. I tried to ask why, but a stony silence had overtaken him.
It’s just me now. If Luca does not return within a day, I will make my own way in.

**Day 29

It appears we were mistaken. I found no relics or diamonds within the caves, and those inside seemed very perturbed by my presence. Not surprising. There are not many who could make it as far as I have.
Despite my disappointment over not findinganything, I have benefitted from this venture. The ~~Ironwallows recognized~~ my status and reputation and we have come to a lucrative agreement. In exchange for not speaking of the company, the substances they were producing, or their quarry’s whereabouts, I have received a tidy payment and only minor bruising.

**Day 30

I have returned to town. Still no sign of Luca, but there is no time to search.
My journals must be edited before they are published. I did not mention them to the ~~Ironwallows~~, but I am sure that striking out details from the text will suffice for satisfying our agreement.
This entry must be left in, of course, to record the first of many successful expeditions by Lord Redmond Islington-Wellerby, master explorer!
