## Recap

In the shadowed depths, the Kawasaki Boys breached the sinister sanctuary of the Red Mask, nestled within the clenched grip of the brass knuckle.

Within those tainted walls, they unearthed forbidden knowledge regarding the enigmatic Dav Firestorm, the mastermind who commands the Interplanar Racing League (IRL) from his stronghold in Greyspace. With blasphemous ingenuity, he had infused his racing machine with the very fabric of the Dimensional Loop—an artifact of unparalleled grandeur, a fragment torn from the ancient Orry of the Wanderer.

As their eyes traced the inked secrets, the Boys discovered tidings of the imminent finale of the carpet race, slated to transpire in the veiled realms of Greyspace, one sphere removed from their current reality. It is there, amidst the murmurs of the cosmic winds, that Dav Firestorm shall converge with destiny, his vehicular might poised for participation.

Further explorations yielded the bounty of a schedule, an ethereal roadmap charting the forthcoming months of rigorous races upon the celestial Rock of Bral. Prelims and qualifiers, a cacophony of engines and ambition, clamored for attention within those dusty scrolls.

Yet, the veil of the unknown did not cease its unravelling. Amidst a sea of aged parchment, the Boys chanced upon a trove of import-export documents, bearing the mark of antiquity. They bore the signature, the letter "B," forever etched upon the crumpled annals. These documents traced the intricate journey of a coveted emerald, once acquired from astral elves, now concealed within the confines of a guarded stronghold. A shard, a mere fragment, lay within their grasp, while a larger, more ominous counterpart—yet to arrive—loomed on the horizon, promised by the passage of a month or so.

Guided by instinct, their gaze wandered amidst the dimly lit chambers of the manor, until their eyes fell upon the emerald of lore.

The emerald's familiarity grips the Boys' minds, a haunting reminder of the devastation witnessed in their very presence. Yet, this single fragment pales in comparison, a mere twentieth in size and weight compared to its monstrous counterpart discovered amidst the refuge. Make no mistake, its potential for destruction remains unabated. Imbued with an otherworldly polish, it assumes the shape of a crystal ball, emanating a sinister radiance that pulses with unholy energy.

As their eyes fixate upon its gleaming surface, a tremor courses through the crystal ball, its tranquil façade disrupted like a tranquil pond disturbed by a stone's impact. In an instant, an ethereal image takes form, revealing a tempestuous storm cloud rent asunder by lightning's wrath.

The storm's fury intensifies, casting an eerie illumination upon a fleet of astral ships gliding through the heavens with ominous grace. Within the depths of your soul, the weight of impending doom resonates, an unyielding connection to an approaching cataclysm.

This fleet transcends the bounds of ordinary comprehension, for it belongs to an ancient race, shrouded in the mists of time. Their knowledge surpasses the limits of mortal understanding, their purpose veiled in mystery.

Amongst this congregation of dread, one ship looms with unfathomable malevolence, christened the Tsunami. It surges through the raging storm, its presence foreboding the annihilation of all we hold dear.

Determined gazes are exchanged between the Boys, for they understand the weighty burden they bear. Within this perilous world, their roles assume a profound responsibility, demanding swift and calculated action.

With resolve etched upon their features, they retreat to the sanctuary of their vessel, a bastion of strategy and contemplation. Within its confines, they must conceive their next moves, as the tempest of uncertainty rages on.

Shall they venture forth to Carcosa, delving into the depths of its enigmatic secrets, in a quest to reclaim the long-lost Orrey of the Wanderer before it falls into the clutches of pirates?

Will they continue their relentless pursuit of pirates, upholding the tenets of the prismatic order of thought, unraveling the threads that bind these nefarious souls?

Or shall they embark upon a journey of investigation, peeling away the layers that enshroud the mysterious orb they have discovered, unraveling its enigmatic purpose?

Alternatively, will they opt to bide their time upon the Rock of Bral, seeking solace and respite amidst the uncertainty, until the tides of fate reveal their hand?

The path ahead remains obscured, a tapestry of uncertainty woven with strands of trepidation. It is within the crucible of their choices that their destiny shall be forged, a journey that resonates with the echoes of an unyielding darkness.
