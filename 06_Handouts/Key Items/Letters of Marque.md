Cruising for prizes with a Letter of Marque was considered an honorable calling combining patriotism and profit, in contrast to unlicensed piracy. 11 During the Revolution, the British, after capturing an American privateer, might consider the officers and crew as traitors and course, quite dangerous. Many privateers operated out of Connecticut waters
