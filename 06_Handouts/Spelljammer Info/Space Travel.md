# Space Travel

Space travel is done using magical ships called spelljammers. These spelljammers are powered by magical helms, which allow them to navigate through the phlogiston and travel between the crystal spheres. The helms are usually located in the rear of the ship and can be controlled by a spelljammer pilot or a spellcaster with the appropriate magic spells (See Spelljamming, p41).

Spelljamming helms are the easiest way to get a ship moving, but are hardly the only way. The dwarves use their forges to propel their great stone citadels, while the eyes of terror use a mutated version of their own species, called an orbus, to provide the necessary power. The mind lashers, who have spell-like abilities, use specially designed helms in series to power their ships.
