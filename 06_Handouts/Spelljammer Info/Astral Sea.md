Wildspace is the vast, empty expanse between the crystal spheres that contains most of the celestial bodies and other hazards that spelljammers must navigate. It is an unpredictable and dangerous place, filled with phenomena such as radiation storms, asteroid fields, and spatial anomalies.

Wildspace also contains a number of inhabited objects, such as asteroids, planetoids, and even planets that are not part of any crystal sphere. These are often home to unique life forms and cultures, and can provide opportunities for trade, exploration, or conflict.

Wildspace is so vast that a ship, however, that even traveling at spelljamming speed can take weeks to cross a single sphere, and a journey between spheres may last for many months.
