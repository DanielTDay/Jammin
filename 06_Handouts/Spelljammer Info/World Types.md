# World Types

Worlds are classified by the most prevalent element in them, listed as Fire, Earth, Air and Water:

- **Fire** worlds are spheres that tend to take the role of suns of their respective systems, and they are characterized by their intense heat and extreme conditions. The surface of these worlds is usually a sea of lava, and the atmosphere is toxic and dangerous to breathe.
- **Earth** worlds are the most common type of world found in the universe. They have a solid surface, an atmosphere with a breathable mix of gasses, and diverse ecosystems. Most habitable worlds fall into this category.
- **Air** worlds are spheres with no solid surface, and their inhabitants live on floating islands or fly using magical or technological means. These worlds are characterized by their turbulent winds and unpredictable weather patterns.
- **Water** worlds are spheres covered entirely by oceans and very few landmass. They are home to many aquatic races, and their environments can range from shallow, coral-filled reefs to deep, dark trenches.
