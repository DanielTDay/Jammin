# The Phlogiston

The Phlogiston is a strange, gaseous substance that fills the void between the different crystal spheres that make up the universe. It is an incredibly volatile and unpredictable substance, often described as a thick, swirling mist or gas that is filled with pockets of pure magical energy, as well as various hazards like explosive gasses, storms, and pockets of utter nothingness. The Phlogiston is also home to many strange and dangerous creatures, including eyes of terror, neogi, and mind lasers, among others.

Spelljamming ships are designed to navigate the Phlogiston, using magical engines and specialized crew members to avoid or overcome the various hazards that the substance presents. Travel through the Phlogiston is always fraught with danger, as ships may encounter anything from hostile creatures to unpredictable magical phenomena at any moment.

Despite its many dangers, the Phlogiston is also a source of great power and opportunity, as it contains vast stores of magical energy that can be harnessed by skilled spellcasters and adventurers, who seek to delve into the Phlogiston, either to uncover its secrets or to seek out riches beyond the known crystal spheres.
