# Weapon Properties

## Climbing
  While you’re wielding a weapon with the climbing property, you have advantage to climb surfaces made out of wood or other materials that the weapon could reasonably puncture. 
  
## Scatter
If you make an attack against a target that is within half of this weapon’s normal range, you may roll the scatter damage dice instead of the weapon’s usual damage dice.

# Weapons

## Simple Melee Weapons
### Hook Hand
1gp 1d4 piercing 1 lb. Light, special

	This weapon is little more than a hook attached to a grip. This weapon can be gripped like a normal weapon or it can be affixed to the end of a creature’s forearm in place of a hand.

## Martial Melee Weapons
### Boarding Axe
10gp 1d8 slashing 5 lb. Climbing

	This axe is a heavier but more compact version of the battleaxe. Due to its smaller size, it can’t be wielded in two hands, but it does allow the wielder to us

### Boarding Pike
5gp 1d6 piercing 3 lb. Climbing, versatile (reach)

	Much like a heavier spear, the boarding pike is a favorite among sailors. While it doesn’t have the same throwing range as a spear, it is far better at puncturing armor, carapace, and flesh. When wielded with two hands, the boarding pike acts much like a glaive or a halberd, just marginally weaker

### Man Catcher
25gp 1d4 bludgeoning 6 lb. Two-handed, reach, special

	This specialized polearm is designed with a circular contraption at the end that can snap closed around an adversary’s neck. When you deal damage with this weapon to a humanoid that has a neck, you may attempt a grapple check against that creature. While grappled, you can’t use this weapon to make another attack without first ending the grapple.

### Partisan
10gp 1d8 piercing 5 lb. Thrown (10/30 ft.), 

## Martial Ranged Weapons
### Harpoon Gun
50gp 1d8 piercing 10 lb. Ammunition (range 40/120), heavy, two-handed, special

	This large two-handed crossbow has a spool of thin but strong rope that can be attached to a crossbow bolt. After firing this weapon, you must use a bonus action to crank the rope back into the spool before making an attack.
	
	When you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature is anchored to you, unable to move any farther away from you than they were when you hit them with the attack. If the creature is larger than you, you are anchored to it instead. While a creature is anchored to you, you may use your action to attempt to pull them close. Make a contested Strength check against the anchored target. On a success, they are pulled 10 feet closer to you. 
	
	The rope has 10 AC and 2 hit points. It can also be burst with a DC 17 strength check. If the rope reaches 0 hit points or is broken, the remaining rope immediately snaps back to the spool, ready to be attached to a new bolt

## Firearms
### Blunderbuss
400gp 1d10 piercing 6 lb. Ammunition (30/90 ft.), loading, scatter (2d6), two-handed

	The classic blunderbuss is a roughly 3 foot long gun with a barrel that flares out into a bell shape. It is able to deliver shot in a wide arc, devastating whoever is on the receiving end.

### Dragon
350gp 1d10 piercing 4 lb. Ammunition (20/60 ft.), loading, scatter (1d12), two-handed

	A dragon is really nothing more than a shorter blunderbuss. Nevertheless, the shorter barrel results in it being a shorter range weapon that can	pack quite the punch.

### Flintlock Pistol
200gp 1d10 piercing 3 lb. Ammunition (30/90 ft.), loading

	The classic flintlock pistol is a muzzle-loaded gun that can deliver considerable damage at short range.

### Musketoon
450gp 1d12 piercing 8 lb. Ammunition (30/90 ft.), loading, two-handed

	Much like the dragon is a shorter version of the blunderbuss, the musketoon is a shorter version of the musket. It packs all the same punch as a musket does, but it can’t fire quite as far.

### Pocket Pistol
150gp 1d6 piercing 1 lb. Ammunition (20/60 ft.), light, loading, special

	This compact pistol is easy to slip away and conceal. Not only are these pistols small enough to effectively wield in both hands, but you can draw two of them with a single object interaction.

### Volley Gun
900gp 2d8 piercing 20 lb. Ammunition (20/60 ft.), heavy, scatter (2d10), special, two-handed

	This giff favorite is a seven-barreled gun built to fire from all barrels simultaneously. The recoil from the gun is considerable, enough that when you fire it, you must succeed on a DC 13 Strength save or be knocked prone. In addition, loading the gun is far more difficult than other gunpowder firearms. After you use this firearm to make an attack, you can’t do so again until a creature uses their action to reload it. The unwieldy nature of the Volley Gun has lead to most using this gun for a quick opening shot before dropping it for a more easily handled weapon.
