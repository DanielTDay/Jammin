### Anchor

Shaped exactly like its seafaring counterpart, this anchor can be lowered down from a ship to land, creating a magical field to keep the wildjammer afloat even if a Helmsman isn’t at the helm powering it

### Arcane Amplifier

The arcane amplifier is a unique module in that it must be installed in a medium or large hardpoint rather than using up cargo space. In place of that hardpoint, this cannon allows a spellcaster to amplify offensive evocation spells to mega scale as mega spells. To use the arcane amplifier, you must be a spellcaster and you must be in the Gunner bridge crew role.

### Arcane Font

This device is another creation by the Arcane to add value to using their helms over others. When installed, this device is attached to a ship’s hull and has a magical connection to the ship’s Wildjammer Helm. As a ship sails, it gathers residual magical energy from the aether and phlogiston. A creature can activate this as an action. When they do, the device casts the Automatic Helm spell at 3rd level. Once this device has been activated, it can’t be used again for 24 hours.

### Astrolabe

This large illusion generated can be affixed to a ship inside of a dark room. When within a crystal sphere, it can be activated to generate an illusory representation of nearly celestial bodies in a 3-dimensional image. It displays their orbital paths, rotations, and current locations relative to your ship. Unfortunately, it can’t pick up particularly small celestial bodies. Although not on the market, it is said there are versions of the Astrolabe that work in the phlogiston to show nearby crystal spheres should you get lost. Unfortunately, they are rare to find.

### Brig

 For whatever reason, a ship might have need of a space where they can lock people up. It might be for keeping a criminal alive on their way back to the law, it could be for disciplining mutinous crew members, or even for transporting slaves. This room is designed for containing up to 5 medium creatures with a reasonable assurance against their escape. The details of the room and the security on it are decided at module installation. If this module is disabled, anyone in the brig is freed to move about the ship as normal.

### Chameleon Orb

The chameleon orb is a large, room-sized orb covered in arcane runes that builds up residual magical energy during a ship’s travels through wildspace which it can use to create a convincing illusion while landed. Anyone aboard a ship can activate the chameleon orb. When activated, it generates an illusion of the surrounding landscape, hiding the ship from the sig

### Fighter Bay

This fighter bay can store one fighter-sized ship for use by a Fighter Helmsman.

### Invisibility Amplifier

The invisibility amplifier is another in the amplifier family of ship modules, taking the form of a pair of large gems embedded on opposite ends of the hull. When a creature casts the Invisibility spell, they can touch the ship and have the spell amplified to mega scale. Until the spell ends, everything inside of the ship’s air bubble is invisible to anyone outside of it. The spell ends early if anyone aboard the ship makes a Ship Weapon Attack, casts a mega spell, or if the ship moves more than 500 feet in a turn.

### Jettison

A jettison is a sectioned off portion of a ship’s cargo hold, usually at the aft section of the ship. When filled with trash and debris, any bridge crew officer can use an action to release it behind the ship. This functions as a physical version of the Jettison spell, cast at 2nd level. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you refill the jettison with debris and trash. The cargo storage of the debris and trash is included in the installation of the jettison. If you choose to store valuables in the jettison, it can hold up to 2 tons of cargo. Be wary, if a jettison is disabled, everything stored inside spills out into wildspace

### Lifeboats

These specialized pods are enchanted to hone in on the nearest planet-sized celestial body with air and fall onto it. If there is no valid target, the lifeboat drifts aimlessly through wildspace, conserving air for those inside for up to a month. Lifeboats are reinforced enough that they can protect the occupants from most damage, and they are small enough that ship weapons lack the precision to hit them. They are too small to have a wildjammer helm or to travel at jamming speeds. Once the lifeboat lands on a planet or runs out of its month of air, it is disabled and becomes inoperable. Each lifeboat takes up 1 ton of cargo space and can carry 5 medium creatures to safety.

### Passage Device

A passage device is an arcanomechanical invention by the Arcane designed to help sell Wildjammer Helms. The device collects residual magical energy during travel which can be accessed by the Helmsman to cast the Create Portal spell once every 24 hours, but it can only be used on ships with a Wildjammer Helm. This added convenience in bypassing the threshold of a crystal sphere has helped to make the Wildjammer Helm

### Plane Shift Amplifier

Another in the amplifier line, this module is a pair of planar attuned gems affixed to the hull of your ship which can resonate with and amplify the power of the Plane Shift spell. When a creature casts the Plane Shift spell, they can touch the ship with their tuning fork and have the spell amplified to mega scale. The spell now transports the ship along with everything and everyone aboard it to the destination of the spell. This amplification doesn’t work unless there is a Helmsman actively attuned to the helm. If this spell is cast on a ship with an unwilling Helmsman, they must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against the spell save DC of the caster to resist the effect.

### Portal Locator

Much like the Passage Device, the Portal Locator was built by the Arcane to help ships get in and out of spheres more easily. Unlike the Passage Device, the Portal Locator isn’t limited to just ships with a Wildjammer Helm. When activated by the Helmsman as an action, this instrument casts the Locate Portal spell and provides the information back to the Helmsman.

### Sending Chamber

A Sending Chamberis a room in the ship with a special sending orb installed. This crystal clear orb allows for long distance communication between ships with a Sending Chamber without the limitations of Sending. This has become an essential tool for many wildjammers. A creature can activate this orb as an action, sending a magical link to the Sending Chamber of another ship with which they are familiar. This link can reach across the spheres, but not between planes. When this link is sent, both orbs become cloudy and the Helmsman of each ship becomes aware of the attempted link. Nothing is conveyed between the link until either the Helmsman or a creature in the Sending Chamber of the destination ship accepts the link. When the link is established, either Helmsman and any creature touching either orb may project their mind into a shared mental space. While in this shared space, the creature’s body is incapacitated and they are not aware of or able to act aboard their ship. Until they leave, they can speak with anyone else in the shared space, as well as project their thoughts and memories into the space around them. If all creatures on one side disengage, the link is severed and the creatures of the other side return to their bodies safely

### Sick Bay

Illness and injury are bound to happen when traveling the stars, and without a dedicated healer aboard, a sickbay is a critical facility. The system has a pool of 6 medical dice, which are 1d8s. Each of these dice recharge 24 hours after being used. Anyone aboard can spend 1 minute in the sickbay to expend one of these dice to regain hit points equal to the die rolled. Alternatively, you can expend 3 medical dice to cure one non-magical poison or disease.

### Workshop

Whether the workshop is a fully functioning forge, a room full of tools and lumber for a carpenter, or bolts of cloth and threads for a tailor, this room provides anything an artisan would need. Someone with an artisan tool proficiency can make use of this workshop to work on projects during travel. Each workshop is built to fit a single tool proficiency.
