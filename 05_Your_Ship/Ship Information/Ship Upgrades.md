### AETHERSAILS

Sails upgrade, requires a ship of Sloop size or larger
These specialized sails are designed to pick up on the
movements in the aether to aid in moving a ship.
Aethersails come in two varieties, and only one can be
installed on a ship at a time.

Adaptable Sails. After moving, your ship can turn an
additional 45º. This doesn’t increase the cone in which
your ship can move, just how much you turn after.

Gliding Sails. Your ship has an extra 500 feet of
movement when moving in a straight line.

### ARCANE WEAPONRY

Ship weapon upgrade, requires a ship weapon
One ship weapon’s firing system is changed from a
physical system to a magical one. To use this weapon, a
Gunner must have the spellcasting or pact magic
feature. When the Gunner makes a ship weapon attack
using this ship weapon, they use their spellcasting
ability modifier instead of their Strength or Dexterity
modifier for the attack roll.

Additionally, if the Gunner
lacks the Extra Attack feature but has access to 3rd level
spell slots, they are considered to have Extra Attack
when using this ship weapon.

### ASSAULT PORT

Module upgrade, requires a Fighter Bay module
A Fighter Helmsman can deploy from Fighter Bays as a
bonus action instead of as an action.

### ENCHANTED HULL

Hull upgrade
Your ship’s hull is enchanted to be stronger, making it
better able to shrug off attacks.
Your ship’s AC is increased by 1.

### ENHANCED WEAPON

Ship weapon upgrade
This enchantment upgrades a ship weapon so that
ammunition fired from it actively seeks to home in on
helms or mega creatures. This weapon has a +1 bonus
to attack rolls and has its normal range increased by
500 ft.

This bonus can increase to +2 and +3, but such magic
is not readily available on the market. Enchantment of
this power level is the work of highly skilled
enchanters and shipwrights.

### GUNPOWDER STATION

Hardpoint upgrade, requires a ship hardpoint
One of your ship’s hardpoints has a gunpowder station
built nearby. Cannons mounted on this hardpoint
ignore the Loading property. You can purchase this
upgrade more than once, applying it to a different
hardpoint each time.

### HELM LINK

Helm upgrade, requires a helm
Your ship’s helm can be linked to the helm of another
willing wildjammer. When either ship accelerates to
jamming speeds, the other is carried along.
Your wildjammer must be able to have a helm to
accept this upgrade.

### REINFORCED BULWARK

Hull upgrade
The ship’s internal reinforcements are fine tuned with
the help of the Boatswain.
Your ship’s bulwark points increase by 8.

### REINFORCED COMPONENT

Module, sails, & ship weapon upgrade
One of your wildjammer's weapons, modules, or your
ship’s sails is reinforced. This weapon, module, or the
ship’s sails have 20 hull points instead of 10. You can
choose this upgrade more than once, applying it to a
different weapon, module, or to your ship’s sails.

### REINFORCED HULL

Hull upgrade
You have improved the integrity of your wildjammer
by padding the hull with lightweight reinforcement.
Your ship’s hull points increase by 16.

### TURRETED HARDPOINT

Hardpoint upgrade, requires a ship hardpoint
One of your wildjammer's hardpoints has a turret
platform added to it. When a Gunner uses a weapon
mounted on this hardpoint, they can use a bonus
action to turn the hardpoint to change the facing of the
mounted weapon. You can choose this upgrade more
than once, applying it to a different hardpoint

### RAM

Fore mantle ship module
This large ram is affixed to the front of a ship is built to
absorb the backlash from colliding with another ship.
While this ram is equipped, when the Helmsman takes
the Collide bridge crew action and hits, the damage dice
this ship takes is reduced to d4s.

### GRAPPLING RAM

Fore mantle ship module
Unlike the a normal ram, a grappling ram isn’t built for
absorbing damage from a forward collision. Instead, it
is designed for grappling another ship so the boarding
party can get aboard quickly and easily.
While this ram is equipped, when the Helmsman
takes the Collide bridge crew action and hits, both ships
are immediately in a ship grapple (escape DC 13).

### GRAPPLER ARMS

Fore mantle ship weapon, Frigate-sized (1x1) or larger
These fore mantle attachment is a set of manipulators
that extend out from the front half of the ship. In lieu
of colliding with an enemy ship, the Helmsman can
use these manipulators to bludgeon or grapple a ship
or mega creature. Grappler arms must be installed at
ship creation, and they cannot be added, removed, or
later replaced by another fore mantle option.
When the Helmsman takes the Collide bridge crew
action while at the Helm of a ship with these arms, the
Helmsman instead moves the ship up to half its speed
within its cone of movement and makes a special ship
weapon attack using their spellcasting ability modifier
instead of their Strength or Dexterity against a ship or
mega creature within 500 feet. The Helmsman is
considered proficient with this weapon. On hit, these
arms deal 2d10 mega bludgeoning damage.
Instead of attacking with these arms, the Helmsman
may attempt to grapple a ship or mega creature. The
Helmsman makes an Athletics check using their
spellcasting ability modifier contested by the target’s
Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics). If the
target is a ship with a Helmsman, that Helmsman may
use their spellcasting ability modifier instead of
Strength or Dexterity for this contested check. The
target of the grapple must be no more than one size
larger than your ship, and it must be within 500 feet of
your ship.

### DRAGON FIGUREHEAD

Fore mantle ship module
The shape of a dragon’s upper body is affixed to the
front of the ship, just below the bowsprit (if any). This
dragon’s head gathers up residual magical power from
the aether that it can release as a breath weapon.
As an action, you may have the figurehead breath
fire in a 3,000-foot cone ahead of the ship. Each ships
or mega creatures in the area must make a Dexterity
saving throw against the Helmsman’s spell save DC.
On a failure, they take 28 (8d6) mega fire damage and
can’t regain bulwark points until the end of your next
turn. On a success, they take half damage and can
regain bulwark points as normal.
Once this ability has been activated, it can’t be used
again for 1 hour.

### COUATL FIGUREHEAD

Fore mantle ship module
A serpentine couatl with rainbow wings is affixed to
the front of the ship, just below the bowsprit (if any).
This couatl gathers up residual magical power from
the aether that it can use to repair the ship.
As an action, you may unleash the power of the
figurehead to repair the ship for 4d4 + your
spellcasting ability modifier.
Once this ability has been activated, it can’t be used
again for 24 hours.

### DISPLACER BEAST FIGUREHEAD

Fore mantle ship module
The image of a displacer beast with its tentacles out to
its sides is affixed to the front of the ship, just below
the bowsprit (if any). The displacer beast gathers up
residual magical power from the aether that it can use
to defend the ship.
As an action, you may activate the figurehead, which
creates magical illusions of your ship nearby its actual
location. This causes attack rolls against your ship to
have disadvantage. If your ship is hit by an attack, this
effect is disrupted until the end of your next turn. This
effect is also disrupted if your ship is destroyed or
grappled by another ship. This effect lasts for 1 minute
or until you dismiss it (no action required).
Once this ability has been activated, it can’t be used
again for 1 hour.
