Many years ago, an evil and reclusive mage from WATERDEEP named KEILIER constructed BLUE ALLEY for his own amusement. He filled it with rich treasures and deadly traps, and enticed adventurers to brave its dangers while he gleefully watched from a hidden location. Although everyone knows Blue Alley is a deathtrap, it has become a rite of passage for young adventurers seeking to establish a reputation. The dungeon is regularly replenished with spelljammer treasure, often stolen from the affluent houses of Waterdeep. Keilier occasionally leaks details of these treasures to the public, and wealthy patrons sometimes sponsor adventuring parties to enter the complex and retrieve a pilfered item. Some speculate that other, darker powers may have supplanted the wizard as lord of Blue Alley. Regardless, those entering the complex usually end up just wanting to find a way out...
