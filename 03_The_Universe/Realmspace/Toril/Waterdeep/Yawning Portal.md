The Yawning Portal is far-and-away the most famous inn in the world. It’s a three-story stone building with a slate gray roof and several chimneys. A signboard that simply reads “The Yawning Portal,” hangs on chains from a black iron pole above the front door, announcing the entry to the inn. Well-worn boards cover the floor, but the main impression is of comfort. Rich blue tapestries of fairytale adventurers decorate the wood-paneled walls of the common room, which consist of a bar and tables of stout wood.

The inn was built in 1306 DR by [[../../../../01_NPCiary/Yawning Portal/Durnan]] on the ruins of Halaster’s Hold. The famous adventurer returned from Undermountain with his adventuring companion [[../../../../01_NPCiary/Yawning Portal/Mirt]] nearly two centuries ago, laden with riches. In this place [[../../../../01_NPCiary/Yawning Portal/Durnan]] built his inn and began a gold-rush of adventurers into the deadly dungeon.
