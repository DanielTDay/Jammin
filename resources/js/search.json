Their descendants still command echoes of that power.","From below, aarakocra look like large birds and thus are sometimes called birdfolk. Only when they roost on a branch or walk across the ground is their Humanoid nature clear.

In the presence of other folk, they often adopt a similar shape, but there’s little chance of mistaking a plasmoid for anything else. They consume food by osmosis, the way an amoeba does, and excrete waste through tiny pores. They breathe by absorbing oxygen through another set of pores, and their limbs are strong and flexible enough to grasp and manipulate weapons and tools. Although most plasmoids are translucent gray, they can alter their color and translucence by absorbing dyes through their pores.","Plasmoids don’t have internal organs of the usual sort. Their bodies are composed of cells, fibers, plasma-like ooze, and clusters of nerves. These nerves enable a plasmoid to detect light, heat, texture, sound, pain, and vibrations. Plasmoids can stiffen the outer layers of their bodies to maintain a humanlike shape, so they can wear clothing and accessories. They speak by forcing air out of tubular cavities that constrict to produce sound.","When plasmoids sleep, they lose their rigidity and spread out and are thus sometimes mistaken for a rock or some other feature of the environment."]}],[{"i":"kachow","l":"Ka'Chow","p":["Auto-Gnome: Small Construct, Lawful Neutral","Pobis"]},{"l":"Description","p":["https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/91116630"]},{"l":"Class","p":["https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/artificer#Artillerist","An Artillerist specializes in using magic to hurl energy, projectiles, and explosions on a battlefield.

The asteroid became a haven for thieves and cutthroats, and among them a few merchants and entrepreneurs set up shop. Even in a climate of lawlessness, the place evolved into something resembling a settlement of citizens. After Captain Bral’s death, the burgeoning city became known as Bral, in his honor, and its location as the Rock of Bral. For the next several decades, various pirate captains held sway in the city, but none of them demonstrated an interest in trying to take over sole leadership of the city.","Eventually, the merchants and tavernkeepers who made their livings on the Rock became as numerous as the pirates and brigands who sought refuge there. One of the pirate captains, Cozar, sensed that times were changing on the Rock—that the days of lawlessness were coming to an end. Through a series of strategic alliances and shrewd business deals, he consolidated his political power and dubbed himself Prince Cozar, the Rock’s first overlord. Under Prince Cozar’s long reign, the city evolved from a pirate hideout into a major city, attracting profit-seekers, adventurers, and other more respectable types.","Upon Cozar’s death, the rule of Bral passed to Frun, his son and heir. Frun was far from an able politician. Rather, he was a hedonist whose overindulgences compromised his authority. Business leaders and other influential types grabbed power where they could, and by the end of his reign, Frun was little more than a figurehead. His only notable accomplishments were the renovation of the royal palace and the construction of the arena that bears his name.","Frun was succeeded by his son, Calar, whose bearing and tastes resembled those of his father but whose time as the overlord lasted only days. Calar died six years ago under mysterious circumstances shortly after taking the throne; his body was found floating in space just beyond the asteroid’s air envelope. Leadership of the Rock passed to Calar’s younger brother, Andru, who had a group of malcontents arrested and executed for the crime within days.","Though his place on the throne is secure for now, Prince Andru is merely one player in a maze of political intrigue. He has a host of agents and forces loyal to him, but he must act with consideration, since he has opponents who would rather see Bral ruled by a more ineffectual leader or by a council that could more easily be influenced. Andru maintains his strong base of support because he is a serious and intelligent person—often likened to his grandfather, Prince Cozar, in this regard—and he isn’t easily intimidated."]},{"l":"Life on the Rock","p":["Bral is populated by an outlandish collection of traders, rogues, mercenaries, pirates, nobles, and entrepreneurs. Generally, law enforcement is sporadic, which means that order is an elusive concept. Most folks who call the Rock home adhere to two principles: mind your own business whenever possible, and enough gold can fix anything.","Place","Cost","Low","30 GP a Month","Middle","100 GP a Month","High","Not Leased/Sold"]},{"l":"Keeping Order","p":["1 Year of Labor Underside","1, 5, Jettisoning","10 Years of Labor Underside","30 Days Labor Underside","5 Years of Labor Underside","Armed Robbery","Arson","Burglary","Confiscation + 5 Years","General lawlessness prevails in much of the city, but that’s not to say that order doesn’t exist. Simply put, most citizens police themselves. No city watch patrols the streets. Tavernkeepers hire muscular folks to break up fights and toss out drunkards.

Every person on the Rock is expected to have enough sense to hang onto their purse and not be taken in by a swindler.","Impalment","Jettisoning","Manslaughter","Murder","Negligent Arson","Offense","Piracy","Provocation","Punishment","Reporting crimes is voluntary, and many folks don’t bother to do so, since the resulting investigation and legal proceedings are likely to take up too much of their time.","Serious crimes, such as arson, can be reported to one of the city’s three magistrates, who preside over the Low City, the Middle City, and the High City, respectively.

Attendants in impeccable livery see to the needs of the palace’s occupants, while armored guards stand vigilant around the grounds."]},{"l":"Lake Bral","p":["Lake Bral fills a chasm and provides most of the water that sustains Bral’s population. The chasm extends through the gravity plane of the asteroid, so that Lake Bral has two surfaces—its topside surface and another in a cavern deep inside the Rock.","Although the lake means that a shortage of water isn’t normally a concern on Bral, the water supply becomes depleted every few years. To replenish it, the Bralian navy embarks on an expedition to latch onto a nearby ice asteroid and bring it back. Before being brought into the Rock’s gravity plane and lowered into the lake, the ice is broken up into manageable pieces.","A natural stone formation, called the Stonebridge, spans a narrow part of the lake."]},{"l":"Festival Grounds and Arena of Frun","p":["The Festival Grounds is a broad parkland used for public gatherings on holidays and as a recreation spot at other times.

The place is occupied by a small staff of agents who act as an intermediary between the mercanes and those who want to do business with them.

Unauthorized visitors who get themselves apprehended are generally assumed to be either spies or prisoners trying to escape."]},{"l":"Citadel","p":["The well-defended fortress at the center of the underside is the command center and barracks for Bral’s army. The Port Tower and the Starboard Tower are connected to the Citadel by narrow, covered walkways.

All these locations enable soldiers to maintain surveillance of the asteroid’s immediate environs, and they are equipped with ballistae and mangonels to defend against an invasion."]},{"l":"Fields","p":["The fruits, vegetables, and grains harvested from the fields on the underside keep the Rock’s occupants well fed without the need for imported foodstuffs.
