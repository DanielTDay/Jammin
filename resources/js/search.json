The asteroid became a haven for thieves and cutthroats, and among them a few merchants and entrepreneurs set up shop. Even in a climate of lawlessness, the place evolved into something resembling a settlement of citizens. After Captain Bral’s death, the burgeoning city became known as Bral, in his honor, and its location as the Rock of Bral. For the next several decades, various pirate captains held sway in the city, but none of them demonstrated an interest in trying to take over sole leadership of the city.","Eventually, the merchants and tavernkeepers who made their livings on the Rock became as numerous as the pirates and brigands who sought refuge there. One of the pirate captains, Cozar, sensed that times were changing on the Rock—that the days of lawlessness were coming to an end. Through a series of strategic alliances and shrewd business deals, he consolidated his political power and dubbed himself Prince Cozar, the Rock’s first overlord. Under Prince Cozar’s long reign, the city evolved from a pirate hideout into a major city, attracting profit-seekers, adventurers, and other more respectable types.","Upon Cozar’s death, the rule of Bral passed to Frun, his son and heir. Frun was far from an able politician. Rather, he was a hedonist whose overindulgences compromised his authority. Business leaders and other influential types grabbed power where they could, and by the end of his reign, Frun was little more than a figurehead. His only notable accomplishments were the renovation of the royal palace and the construction of the arena that bears his name.","Frun was succeeded by his son, Calar, whose bearing and tastes resembled those of his father but whose time as the overlord lasted only days. Calar died six years ago under mysterious circumstances shortly after taking the throne; his body was found floating in space just beyond the asteroid’s air envelope. Leadership of the Rock passed to Calar’s younger brother, Andru, who had a group of malcontents arrested and executed for the crime within days.","Though his place on the throne is secure for now, Prince Andru is merely one player in a maze of political intrigue. He has a host of agents and forces loyal to him, but he must act with consideration, since he has opponents who would rather see Bral ruled by a more ineffectual leader or by a council that could more easily be influenced. Andru maintains his strong base of support because he is a serious and intelligent person—often likened to his grandfather, Prince Cozar, in this regard—and he isn’t easily intimidated."]},{"l":"Life on the Rock","p":["Bral is populated by an outlandish collection of traders, rogues, mercenaries, pirates, nobles, and entrepreneurs.

This statue design is the same as the current statue, except for one main difference: The Yellow-Robed figure, the Visitor, has their hood down, revealing its face. It is the face of Pobis the autognome...","The adventurers took control of their Spelljammer ship, a vessel for exploration and adventure across the vastness of astral space. They set their sights back toward toward the Rock of Bral where they will exchange the finger of Pirate Erik with Prince Andru proving that he will no longer be a burden for the Prigmatic Order of Thought.","And so, the adventurers sailed into the void of astral space, guided by their courage, wisdom, and camaraderie, ready for the next chapter in their epic saga. As they charted a course into the Rock of Bral, they left behind a legacy that would be remembered for ages to come, as the legendary heroes who saved the town of Refuge. The end of one adventure marked the beginning of another, but it wasn't just the treasures of the universe that they sought. The bond forged through their shared quest had become unbreakable, and they continued to stand by each other's side as they embarked on new journeys, facing challenges and dangers together."]}]]
