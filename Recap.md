After daunting challenges on the planet Chakarak in Clusterspace our adventurers make their way out of the small town of Refuge. They had aided in reconstruction of ancient ruins, worked with a group of outlaws to rob a bank, and had faced a formidable foe to obtain the artifact that saved this town and planet from an impending catastrophe.



As they took the elevator down into the mines they found themselves facing the villainous pirate Erik who sought to keep them from escaping this town trapped in time. Erik's power was immense from consuming power from the chalice and the battle was grueling. Spells fired, blades clashed, bullets fired, and the adventurers fought with every ounce of strength they had.



With unwavering determination and masterful teamwork, the adventurers managed to weaken and execute the pirate, popping the bubble that had trapped poor June and the artifact in Time with the Chance Lance. The cups temptations were no match for the resolve of our adventurers. In the aftermath, the adventures learned more about each other and how they came together to form a team and in a race against time during their final loop, the adventurers poured all their knowledge and skills into escaping and saving the town from its untimely demise.



As the dust settled, the adventurers surveyed the aftermath of their hard-won victory. The town of Refuge was safe from the crystal gem that had been rained down upon them 5 years prior. In 10 minutes 5 years pass by in Refuge as they watched from outside the bubble as the town caught up with the current time and saw their ship gracefully land at noon. The adventurers saw weddings, funerals, good days, bad days, and all manner of days in between. Most importantly though, they saw that the citizens of Refuge are happy. It looks as though the loops they've gone through have brought them all closer together.



As Refuge begins to catch up to the present and the time inside the bubble begins to slow down, the citizens had begun to wait patiently by the sign they built. Once the bubble silently pops, the crowd rushed towards the adventurers. They celebrated the "heroes" that have been standing guard outside of Refuge for 5 years, as you walked through town you noticed that Luca is no longer a Skeleton, Cassidy had been made the new Elder of Refuge, June is alive, and lastly the kids had made a clay statue of Roswell near the town's main statue. 



The town was saved, and the inhabitants of the town would be forever grateful for their heroism. They would be hailed as saviors and revered as champions, their names etched in the history as a symbol of hope and inspiration. However another mystery arose, as they lifted off they were greeted by another figure on the bow of their ship, a figure cloaked in yellow... The Yellow-Robe began to lose its composure and violently emit bolts of electricity, then fell to its knees and began muttering to itself, saying, "Avi ...they don't trust me. I can't do it anymore Avi. I'm sorry." A scroll tube lands on the ground, having fallen out. As the figure fizzles out of existence were seen reaching for the tube speaking again, "If you open that tube, it's going to be harder for me to protect you..."



Upon opening the tube, one parchment contains the design for the Statue in the middle of Refuge depicting Jack, June, and the Visitor. There is a date on the lower corner.



The other parchment appears to be an older, earlier draft of the same statue - this is noted due to an earlier date scribbled on the corner. This statue design is the same as the current statue, except for one main difference: The Yellow-Robed figure, the Visitor, has their hood down, revealing its face. It is the face of Pobis the autognome...



The adventurers took control of their Spelljammer ship, a vessel for exploration and adventure across the vastness of astral space. They set their sights back toward toward the Rock of Bral where they will exchange the finger of Pirate Erik with Prince Andru proving that he will no longer be a burden for the Prigmatic Order of Thought. 



And so, the adventurers sailed into the void of astral space, guided by their courage, wisdom, and camaraderie, ready for the next chapter in their epic saga. As they charted a course into the Rock of Bral, they left behind a legacy that would be remembered for ages to come, as the legendary heroes who saved the town of Refuge. The end of one adventure marked the beginning of another, but it wasn't just the treasures of the universe that they sought. The bond forged through their shared quest had become unbreakable, and they continued to stand by each other's side as they embarked on new journeys, facing challenges and dangers together.
